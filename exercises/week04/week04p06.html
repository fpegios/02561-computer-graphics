                                A normal vector is linearly interpolated across the surface of the polygon from the polygon's vertex normals. 
                                The surface normal is interpolated and normalized at each pixel and lighting is computed per fragment.

                                <b>Flat shading</b>, also called 'constant shading' and 'faceted shading' applies an illumination model once to determine a single 
                                intensity value that is then used to shade an entire polygon, and holding the value across the polygon to reconstruct the polygon's 
                                shade. This approach is valid if several assumptions are true:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The light source is at infinity, so N.L is constant across the polygon face.</li>
                                    <li>The viewer is at infinity, so N.V is constant across the polygon face.</li>
                                    <li>The polygon represents the actual surface being modelled, and is not an approximation to a curved surface.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <!-- Gouraud Shading -->
                        <div class="answer">
                            <p>
                                <b>Gouraud shading</b>, also called 'intensity interpolation shading' or 'color interpolation shading', eliminates intensity 
                                discontinuities.  Gouraud shading extends the concept of interpolated shading applied to individual polygons by interpolating 
                                polygon vertex illumination values that take into account the surface being approximated. The Gouraud shading process requires 
                                that the normal {perpendicular vector} be known for each vertex of the polygonal mesh.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next step in Gouraud shading is to find 'vertex intensities' by using the vertex normals with any desired illumination model. 
                                Finally, each polygon is shaded by linear interpolation of vertex intensities along each edge and then between edges along each scan line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With gouraud shading, we get visible specular highligts on vertices, but don't see much of the specular
                                highlight if it should be on the inside of a triangle. Around the specular highlight, we see noticable poolygon
                                edges. Specular highlights will appear to jump from vertex to vertex when moving the model, camera or light source.
                                The quality of the specular highlights depends on the number of vertices in the model.

                                <b>Phong shading</b>, also known as 'normal-vector interpolation-shading', interpolates the surface normal vector N, 
                                rather than the intensity. Interpolation occurs across a polygon span on a scan line, between starting and ending 
                                normals for the span. These normals are themselves interpolated along polygon edges from vertex normals that are computed,
                                if necessary, just as in Gouraud shading. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At each pixel along a scan line, the interpolated normal is normalised, and is backmapped into the WC {world coordinate} 
                                system or one isometric to it, and a new intensity calculation is performed.

                                <b>Note 1:</b> The implications of using flat-shading in graphics is that, for high realism and detail levels, a large number of 
                                flat-shaded polygons is needed for a good-looking image. Models can contain millions of polygons, yet the faceted nature of the 
                                model will still be visible in certain areas. Very high detail requires a 
                                ridiculous number of polygons when using flat shading and as such it's not a technique that one would or should ever use for 
                                situations which require realism. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Flat-shading is fast and ok for prototyping and testing, but is of little value for realistic games. Note that none of the next-gen 
                                consoles could cope with a multi-million polygon mesh in real-time, by which I mean 25fps or higher (one would need a flat-shaded 
                                polygon performance of about 240 million/second, which is about 200 times greater than that which even the best of the consoles can manage). 
                                In practice, the use of texture mapping enables one to vastly reduce the number of polygons required. In the case of planetary models, 
                                the increased realism gained from texture mapping would enable a reduction from having to use more than a million flat-shaded polygons
                                to only a few thousand textured polygons.
                            </p>

                                <b>Note 2:</b> Morevoer, Gouraud shading doesn't produce images as realistic as Phong shading when specular lights are involved, 
                                but Phong shading is a much more mathematically complex task (ie. it's slower). In practice, because the new games consoles use 
                                texture mapping anyway, the use of Phong shading would be a waste of computing resources; hence, none of the new consoles have the 
                                ability to do Phong shading. On the other hand, all of them can do Gouraud shading; when used in combination with texture mapping, 
                                Gouraud shading makes for good realistic scenes, though it does help considerably if good quality detailed textures are used in 
                                the first instance.

                                The main difference is that a <b>directional light</b> does not have a position. 
                                So the rays of a directional light are all parallel, while the rays of a <b>point light</b> 
                                radiate outwards from that point.
